        - Recruited & scheduled participants, ran trials on children, organized lab protocols, led lab meetings
        - Studied children's employment of queue vs. pushdown stack models on center-embedded & cross-serial recursive structures
        - Analyzed data of 40 recruited participants on R, found results corroborating hypothesis (p < .0001)

        - Directed study examining effect of Heavy Noun Phrase Shift (HNPS) on linguistic processing under the supervision of Dr. Laura Johnson for 8 weeks
        - Researched the attentional-gate model of time perception and cross-linguistic accounts of HNPS
        - Analyzed gathered data from 23 participants and found results corroborating hypothesis (p = .021) and in line with prior findings, indicating HNPS likely eases processing
