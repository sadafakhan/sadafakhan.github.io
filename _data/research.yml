      institution: NVIDIA
      year: 2024
      description:
        - Published as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11704v1">Nemotron-4 340B Technical Report</a>
        - Designed human content safety red teaming procedure in PRD, in concert with automated red teaming (garak) and safety evaluation (AEGIS)
        - Recruited, trained, and proctored red teamers
        - Analyzed log results with AI Safety team, drafted 340B's model card to include pertinent outcomes

    - title: Recursive sequence generation in monkeys, children, US adults, and native Amazonians
      institution: Harvard University Laboratory of Developmental Studies
      year: 2019
      description:
        - Studied the development of recursive structures in 3-6 years old with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sferrigno/home?authuser=0">Dr. Stephen Ferrigno</a> for 10 weeks, now published as <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aaz1002">Recursive sequence generation in monkeys, children, US adults, and native Amazonians in <i>Science Advances 6</i>(26).</a>
        - Studied children's employment of queue vs. pushdown stack models on center-embedded & cross-serial recursive structures
        - Recruited, scheduled, and ran trials on child participants, organized lab protocols, led lab meetings
        - Analyzed data of 40 recruited participants on R, found results corroborating hypothesis (p < .0001) that children learn cross-serial structures before center-embedded ones 

    - title: Linguistics Thesis
      institution: Pomona College Linguistics Cognitive Science Department
      year: 2020
      description:
        - My graduating thesis for the Linguistics major, under the supervision of Dr. Michael Diercks and Dr. Franny Brogan:<a href="/assets/pdf/Zabaan.pdf"> Zabaan; Vowel Drift from Classical Persian in Urdu and Tehrani Farsi</a>
        - Executed a phonological elicitation study examining how vowels /a/ and /a:/ from Classical Persian are pronounced in modernity by Urdu & Farsi speakers
        - Gathered 15 hours of interview data using an H5 recorder in a soundbooth, processed data with Praat and R
        - Found preliminary evidence that /a/ went to /æ/ in Farsi vs. /ə/ in Urdu, whereas /a:/ went to /ɒ/ in Farsi vs. /ɑ/ in Urdu, in line with <a href="https://www.academia.edu/3560311/Perso-Arabic_Loanwords_in_Hindustani_Part_II_Linguistic_Study"> prior findings</a>
    
    - title: Cognitive Science Thesis
      institution: Pomona College Linguistics Cognitive Science Department
      year: 2020
      description:
        - My graduating thesis for the Cognitive Science major, under the supervision of Dr. Robin Melnick:<a href="/assets/pdf/Embedded_Recursion.pdf"> Psychological Realities of Embedded Recursion</a>
        - Directed a self-paced reading study evaluating how the ability to parse recursive structures scales with types of recursion (center-embedded, tail-embedded, etc.)
        - Gathered data through Amazon MTurk & Ibex Farm, processed data with R
        - Results supported the notion that higher numbers of embeddings within center-embedded recursion causes a failure in parsing

    - title: Research Assistant
      institution: Pomona College Linguistics Cognitive Science Department
      year: 2018
      description:
        - Directed study examining effect of Heavy Noun Phrase Shift (HNPS) on linguistic processing under the supervision of Dr. Laura Johnson for 8 weeks
        - Researched the attentional-gate model of time perception and cross-linguistic accounts of HNPS
        - Analyzed gathered data from 23 participants and found results corroborating hypothesis (p = .021) that HNPS likely eases processing, in line with <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749596X98925864"> prior findings</a>
