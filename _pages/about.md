Hi all! I'm Sadaf (/sʌd̪əf/), and I'm a linguist in the AI space! I'm particularly interested in <b>AI safety</b>, <b>machine translation</b>, and <b>automated speech recognition (ASR)</b>, especially in relation to second language acquisition (SLA), multilingual input, and assistive technology. 


In my free time, I draw, write, eat peaches, and galavant in the Sierra Nevadas (pictured right) hiking and climbing. 

<!-- Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
