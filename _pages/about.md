Hello, I'm Sadaf (/sʌd̪əf/), and I'm a computational linguist looking for work in Natural Language Processing (NLP)! 

I love studying linguistics, and am eager to use computational methods to answer bigger questions. I am particularly drawn to machine translation and automated speech recognition (ASR), especially as they relate to second language acquisition (SLA), multilingual input, and accented speech. 

I graduated with an M.Sc. in Computational Linguistics from the University of Washington in Dec. 2022, and completed a B.A. in Linguistics and Cognitive Science (with a Computer Science concentration) from Pomona College in May 2020.
